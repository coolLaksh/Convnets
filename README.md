# ConvNets from Scratch
Architecture Iverview:        

                        INPUT - CONV1 - RELU - CONV2 - RELU - MAXPOOL - FULLY_CONNECTED_LAYER - OUTPUT



This project involves the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) from scratch using Python and NumPy. The architectural flow consists of an input layer, followed by a convolutional layer (CONV1) with ReLU activation, another convolutional layer (CONV2) with ReLU activation, a max-pooling layer for spatial down-sampling, a fully connected layer, and finally, the output layer. The project provides scripts for training the ConvNet (`train.py`) and evaluating the trained model (`evaluate.py`). Users can customize the dataset by replacing the contents of the `data/` directory and adjust hyperparameters in the `train.py` script. Contributions are welcome through issues or pull requests. The project is licensed under the MIT License, and acknowledgments go to the deep learning community for inspiration and resources. Happy coding!
